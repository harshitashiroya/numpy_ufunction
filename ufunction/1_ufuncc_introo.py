#UFUNCS

"""
ufuncs stands for "Universal Functions" and
they are NumPy functions that operate on the ndarray object.

ufuncs also take additional arguments, like:-
where -  boolean array or condition defining where the operations should take place.
dtype - defining the return type of elements.
out - output array where the return value should be copied.

What is Vectorization?
Converting iterative statements into a vector based operation is called vectorization.
